            <img class="hero-img" src="images/image2.png">
            <p>The National Alliance on Mental Illness blog features topics on racism, COVID-19, and trauma. NAMI is a national organization that provides mental health support and resources. They also work to educate and empower those living with mental illness to live fulfilling lives.
                NAMI’s blog also reflects current events and how they shape our mental health. From a recent post written by a black woman experiencing anxiety during National Black History Month: “Naturally, I get excited when I can talk about my personal experiences to help people understand the bigger picture. However, as I started to write a title for this blog, I could feel my heart rate rise, my hands begin to jitter on the keyboard, and my chest tightening… I only recently started speaking out about generational trauma, racism, and being Black in America because, at times, the anxiety and fear can be too much to bear.”</p>

            <h1>Blurt</h1>
            <img class="hero-img" src="images/image3.png">
            <p>Sometimes, the best way to talk about depression is just to blurt it out. The team at Blurt knows this, and that’s why they’re encouraging you to talk about it. They’re a social enterprise dedicated to creating positive change, and they want you to know that they’re here for you.</p>
               <p> From a recent blog post on active listening versus just hearing: “As with everything else in life, there’s no ‘one size fits all’ method for an effective conversation and we can’t assume that someone isn’t listening to us based on a generalized idea of what active listening looks like. Through getting to know people, we will learn how they prefer to communicate and we’ll learn to spot when they’re hearing, and when they’re actively listening.”

            <h1>A splintered mind</h1>
            <img class="hero-img" src="images/image4.png">
         <p>If you struggle with keeping your thoughts in order, you likely will appreciate Douglas Cootey’s award-winning ADHD and depression blog. He’s been writing on his mental illness journey since 2005, something that he jokes about is amazing considering he has an attention deficit disorder. Humorous and honest, this is a good blog for anyone who needs to know they’re not alone or a good laugh.</p>

           <p> “Sometimes I wonder if there’s a support group out there for adults with ADHD who have an open tabs addiction,” he writes in one post. “Hello, my name is Douglas Cootey, and I’m a hard-core tabs junkie.”</p>
            
           <p>That isn’t to say his content is all about humor. In his latest blog post, he shares how useless well-meaning advice for depressed or suicidal people really is sometimes. A former bishop of his often changes the subject if he talks about his work or tells him he needs to stop letting his disability define him. “I’m sure he means well, but since I don’t recall him ever taking time to find out how my disability affected me in the first place, his advice is useless to me.”</p>
